### Key Features:
- **Profile Creation:** Users can create a cutom profile.
- **Skill Management:** Users can add and remove skills directly from their dashboard profiles, showcasing their evolving expertise.
- **Skill-Based Search:** A comprehensive search feature enables users to find like-minded peers based on skills.
- **Availability Filter:** Users can filter search results by remote availability and view results by proximity.
- **Meeting Requests:** Once a potential match is found, users can submit meeting requests, providing an avenue for meaningful connections.
- **Approval/Decline:** Meeting requests can be approved, adding the meeting to both users' schedules, or declined, removing the request.
- **Dark Mode:** To enhance the user experience, light and dark mode can be toggled in the navigation.
